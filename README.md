# About Me
## My Interests
- I like to play different songs of different genres on my drumset, I love gaming on both pc and console, I like hanging out with friends usually on fridays
- I'm also very dedicated when it comes to going to the gym, I usually go with 3 of my closest friends everyday from monday to friday and then we take breaks on the weekend
## Websites I Recommend
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I think youtube is a very important, informative and entertaining web page since you can find tutorials, explanations or solutions
  to almost anything that you can think of or if maybe you're looking for something to entertain yourself there's surely gonna be content in there that you'll like.
  
- [Chat-gpt](https://chatgpt.com/) - Chat gpt can be very helpful depending on the use you give to it, you can obtain very accurate information on certain topics,
  find solutions to some of your problems, you can even get advice for personal matters although thats not recommended because even though chat gpt holds a lot of information
  with its indecisiveness it may not give you the best or optimal answer to your problem
